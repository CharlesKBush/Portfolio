			<h1>About the Author</h1>
			<hr/>
			<p>
The Author of this page is quite a pokemon fan himself. Over the years he has watched the shows, played the games, collected the cards, bought the mersh, and more. His earliest memory of pokemon is when he was in 2nd or 3rd grade (the exact date is unknown) he was randomly given a card (which he still has) after noticing his classmate had some cards in his hands. Shortly after he'd start to collect the trading cards and watch the tv show. Then after his love for pokemon was starting to slow he got a pokemon diamond for his birthday. To say the least, he played the heck out of that game, and despite beating twice, he would complete the national living Pokedex in that game almost 4 years later. (The national Pokedex includes every pokemon up to that game which was 493 at the time) ("living" Pokedex is when you have 1 of each pokemon in your boxes this means having every form of that pokemon's evolution. Even despite some pokemon being outright unobtainable, with his friend he caught several that were locked behind live events years ago. Now he still regularly plays pokemon games, while he doesn't watch the show or collect any new cards(He's proud of his current collection) he is still a major fan of the franchise and is happy that this assessment exists. Now he has 6 main series games and 2 spin-off games on his ds's alone, with quite a few hours, put into some of the games. He's clocked in around 500 hours in pokemon diamond alone! He also has many fond memories of trade pokemon cards with his friends in elementary school. Most of which he still has and more often than not are his favorites along with ones his grandma got him while at a garage sale. He is rather attached to his older cards and the ones he has memories with rather than the newer ones. After all of this and out of all his life some of his favorite memories include pokemon and will likely continue to do so. With a lot of replayability and shiny hunting, his passion won't die out any time soon." Shiny hunting " is a search for a uniquely colored pokemon, however, these pokemon are incredibly rare. With a whopping 1 out of 8192 chances of happing per encounter the pokemon will have a special partial effect activate along with its unique color. Examples of this include the flames on a pokemon going from red/orange to blue this simple color change is heavily desired among hardcore fans, many of which spend days to months hunting them. They are a way of showing prestige and your love for the franchise or your favorite pokemon which is what you'd usually hunt. Even the author has some of these 1/8192 pokemon but only a handful of them. One of which is the in cannon god of the pokemon universe.
